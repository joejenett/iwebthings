When I run into something I find relatable, I love sharing it. That’s what I do here after all.

<a title="Robin Rendle — Why are websites embarrassing?" href="https://robinrendle.com/notes/why-are-websites-embarrassing/">Why are websites embarrassing?</a>
<blockquote>
<p>
...when I find a beautiful website, something that pushes the whole thing forwards, I want to loudly celebrate it.
</p>
</blockquote>
The author, Robin Rendle, is talking about the sorry state of ‘modern’ web design as a professional web designer. What the client wants doesn’t always result in websites ‘worthy of our browsers.’
<blockquote><p>They’re slow, hard to navigate, and plagued with visual crap; pop-ups, bad typography, newsletter modals, and everything else imaginable. </p></blockquote>
Thanks for saying that Robin!
