Just finished a big link fixing project at  <a href="https://dwt-archives.joejenett.com/">the dailywebthing archives</a>. When I created the site, there were over 8,900 posts, Iâ€™m pleased after all of the bad links fixed since then, thereâ€™s still 7,470 posts. Thatâ€™s a whole lotta good links left to explore.

Though I hate to borrow a word from a certain cable giantâ€™s advertising arsenal, I gotta say bulltown is booming.The amount of time spent maintaining its two versions and interacting in Neocitiesâ€™ community is substantial and worth every minute of it! Iâ€™m grateful for the experience.

Not much else to report at the moment â€™cept that the <em>webthings</em> are keepinâ€™ me busy (and out of trouble) and Iâ€™m down with that. ðŸ˜Ž

Have a great weekend!
