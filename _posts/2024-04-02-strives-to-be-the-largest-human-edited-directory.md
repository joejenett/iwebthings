I’m tickled to see this one is back online. I removed it from the dailywebthing archives last week due to a 503 (Service Unavailable) error that persisted for several days. The successor of the Open Directory Project (which later became DMOZ) is still here - whoopee!

<small>Update 04/03/24: The site appears to be down again this morning - # 504 Gateway Time-out error. Fingers crossed. I’ll be watching this one and decided to keep the link active for new.</small>
