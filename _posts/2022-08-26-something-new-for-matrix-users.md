<p>I‚Äôve discovered a lot of interesting things from  a guy named <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:mikael">mikael</a> - besides tons of cool pointers, I also discovered the Matrix protocol on his <a href="https://merveilles.town/@mikael">@mikael profile</a>. I hope he knows how much I appreciate him for all of that and for putting up with my using him a bit (about a month ago) to check out what communicating with Matrix was like. üôèüèª</p>
<p>Since then, I found a commenting system based on the Matrix protocol which allows visitors to post comments without having to log in (though Matrix users can log in if they prefer to follow the conversation in their Matrix client). I like that and decided to implement <a href="https://cactus.chat/">Cactus Comments</a> on this blog and at <em>simply</em>. And now, on to the new thing...</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been dabbling with an idea:  the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#i.webthings:matrix.org">i.webthings caf√©</a>, a place to hangout and talk about websites or linking or anything else about the web. For those who use Matrix, the room also includes feeds from several of the <em>webthings</em>.</p>
<p>Another thing I‚Äôm considering is setting up a page for <em>the caf√©</em> with Cactus Comments integrated so anyone can join in on the conversation here on the site, even if they don‚Äôt use Matrix. As usual, my idea is in its early stage and for all I know, might not work. Hopefully, it will. So, I‚Äôve got questions:</p>
<p><ul><li>Whataya think?</li><li>Do you use Matrix, Discord, and/or Telegram?</li></ul></p>
<p>Please let me know, if for no other reason, to see if my fancy new commenting system works. Thanks.</p>

I have tried giving Matrix a chance but I can't peel myself away from IRC. I wish that more people still used it but it seems like nothing will bring people back to it. Nevertheless, the new system that you have here is pretty neat. I was refraining from commenting with your previous setup but this is more enticing.</p>

Hey Poorchop - thanks. The GitHub only approach didn't sit right with me either. Now you've got me thinking about IRC which is a good thing. 'cause there's a way to create a bridge between Matrix and IRC (which I'll be looking into soon). Have a great day!
