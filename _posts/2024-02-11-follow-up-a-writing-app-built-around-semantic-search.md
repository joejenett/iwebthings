Last month I <a href="/a-writing-app-built-around-semantic-search/">shared</a> a link to <a href="https://nomadhypertext.nicholaschen.io/">Nomad Hypertext</a>:
<blockquote><p>It lets you see connections between your ideas in real time as your write - click on the # symbol next to a paragraph, and similar ideas you've written about in the past will show in the sidebar. This helps you spot both recurring themes and unexpected links between seemingly different ideas.</p></blockquote>
I’ve been using the app since then and recently decided to check out the <a href="https://github.com/nichwch/yurt">static site generator</a> developed by the same guy.

I’m inspired by how the app helps me gain new insights into my scattered ideas and yes, it’s a most effective _brainstormer!_

Though still a work in progress, I’m tickled to share my latest _webthing_, my online <a href="https://brainstormer.joejenett.com">brainstormer</a>. As a start, I’ve included a number of _tiddlers_ from <a title="🌱 𝚓𝚘𝚎. 𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚊𝚜." href="https://ideas.joejenett.com/">🌱 𝚓𝚘𝚎. 𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚊𝚜.</a> along with an assortment of other ideas floating around in my mind. It should be interesting as I add more notes to it.

Enjoy (I hope)!
