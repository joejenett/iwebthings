[David R. MacIver](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/) has posted 27 _thoughts_ this month, each one a well written glimpse into his life - well written stuff.

[Amit Gawande](https://www.amitgawande.com/) started a [30Day challenge](https://www.amitgawande.com/categories/30day/) on January 7 - pictures taken on morning walks - nice!

I enjoy futzing around in GarageBand and so does [Paul Bausch](https://www.onfocus.com/2022/01/8293/music-tiny-metal) - 3 _Tiny Metal_ pieces - _just enough metal before bed_â„¢.

And if you feel like _exploring_, [Marginalia Search](https://search.marginalia.nu/) added a [browse:random](https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random) feature I really like and I just noticed that [Ye Olde Blogroll](https://blogroll.org/) includes a RSS preview button for each listing.

Stay warm and enjoy your Sunday!
