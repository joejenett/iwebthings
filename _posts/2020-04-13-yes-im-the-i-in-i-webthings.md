<div style="font-size:1.2em;line-height:1.5em;">
<p>I remember referring to a certain doctor with major skills in a rare specialty as the cowboy who came out of the night to save me some years ago. That&#8217;s <em>cowboy</em> in a most affectionate way &#8211; it was my way of complimenting him. It&#8217;s a favorable term to me and if someone called me a cowboy, I would probably take it as a compliment.</p> 

<p>
So when I read <a href="https://www.kickscondor.com/okay-shut-up-about-me-now/" title="Okay, Shut Up About Me Now">this</a> and saw the term <em>link cowboy</em> and indulged my inner narcissist a bit, I told myself, “If anyone&#8217;s a link cowboy, I am.” I wondered if Kicks might indeed be referring to me. Naw, that&#8217;s ridiculous Joe &#8211; get over yourself! “Silly,” I thought, pushing my ego and its dumb thoughts to the back of my mind.
</p>

<p>
Of course, I had still been thinking those silly thoughts for almost a month when I came across <a href="https://www.kickscondor.com/hrefhunt-for-march-2020/" title="HrefHunt for March 2020">this</a> and <a href="https://www.kickscondor.com/link-cowboys/" title="Link Cowboys">this</a> (yet another cool video by Kicks) and my ego lit up like a lavalamp. Though the message in the entertaining video was ambiguous, here I was saying “Damn! He is talking about me.” My inner narcissist won and I was doomed to responding in some way (though I knew better).
</p>

<p>
I did respond and learned I was totally wrong about what he was saying and who he was talking about. I&#8217;d been here before. I&#8217;m human.
</p>

<p>
The truth is I love this guy&#8217;s attitude. He teaches us/me things in a most peculiar way.
