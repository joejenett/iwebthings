After spending more time this morning further exploring several recently shared links, I’ve decided <a href="https://iwebthings.joejenett.com/are-we-on-the-verge-of-something-big-here/">yesterday’s post</a> will soon be revised. As you may have noticed, I used a slightly different method of sharing links in the post than I normally do, by including additional information as to what made me want to share them and a brief summary of the ideas gleaned from the linked sites. 

Though I remain excited and inspired by the initiatives shared in the post, the revisions are an attempt to more accurately (and completely) present them to you.

I’d like to think every new day is an opportunity to try out doing something in a new way. Have a great one!
