Thanks to <a title="source" href="https://pinboard.in/u:jshwlkr">jshwlkr@pinboard</a>, I came upon the following this morning:

<a title="The Pixel Canvas Shimmer Effect" href="https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/pixel-canvas/">The Pixel Canvas Shimmer Effect</a> <small>(<a href="https://github.com/hexagoncircle/pixel-canvas">github</a>)</small>

So linkguy and I have been playing around with it for the last hour, hoping to show you an example of the cool effect and though we got it to work offline, I’m sorry to tell we’re still working on it (but still having fun).
