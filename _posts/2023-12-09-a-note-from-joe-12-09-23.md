If you’ve wondered where I’ve been lately, I’ve been right here all along, hoping today would come. I’m on the way back from a fall into illness that started a few days before Thanksgiving and today, I’m finally celebrating the holiday I missed. It’s been a rocky ride my friends and I’m especially thankful to be right here right now. Fortunately, a good friend posted <a title="Life in Links 54 – John's World Wide Wall Display" href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/life-in-links-54/">Life in Links 54</a> this morning which made my getting back on track easier than I could ever imagine. Enjoy!

<p>
 Please stay tuned - I’m back. And thanks John!
