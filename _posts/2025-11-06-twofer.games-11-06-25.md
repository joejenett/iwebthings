	It’s been a challenging week my friends, grappling with a long list of home network and computer issues. Now that those issues are about 90% resolved, I needed a different kinda challenge this morning - a few fun diversions if you will. And thanks to game aficionado <a title="source" href="https://pinboard.in/u:tdjones">tdjones at Pinboard</a>, I found these two cool gems to heal my sorry ass. Enjoy!
