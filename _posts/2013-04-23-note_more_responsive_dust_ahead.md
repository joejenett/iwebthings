So. After having finished the responsive redesign of [the dailywebthing](http://dailywebthing.com/linkport/) recently (though some ongoing tweaking continues), I decided to do the same here. I&#8217;ll be testing new templates and implementing changes here on the live site for the next few days, so if you should encounter something funky, it&#8217;s probably temporary. And yes, I am having fun!
