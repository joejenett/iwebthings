<p>It’s been over 72 hours since the fiasco with my current hosting provider began and from what I can see, they seem to be in meltdown mode. This site is not affected because it’s hosted elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve begun taking measures to resolve some of the issues though I am somewhat limited by the now faulty infrastructure which exists at my current hosting provider for most of my other sites.</p>
<p>I am sorry and will continue doing what I can to restore my beloved <em>webthings</em>. Thanks for hanging in there with me and please pardon the dust...</p>
