If you’ve been to the _i.webthings hub_ before, you probably know I rely heavily on following a network of <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> users to find many of the links I share here. If you’re logged in to Pinboard, you can view the long list of <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:iwebthings/network/">curators in my network</a>. 

One of the top 2 sources of links for me is <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:tdjones">tdjones</a> - aside from numerous dev resources, they find the coolest online games. Many of the games they’ve found have already been shared here (see <a href="/linkylove-01-25-24/">1</a> <a href="/assemble-the-target-word-using-the-fewest-spins-possible/">2</a> <a href="/linkylove-01-17-24/">3</a> for examples) and today’s list includes three more somewhat challenging games from the same source:
<ul class="links">
	<li><a title="Dicele | Daily Math Puzzle Games for Fun and Learning" href="https://dicele.com/">Dicele</a></li>
	<li><a title="Math Crossword: Drag & Drop Your Way to Math Mastery" href="https://scientific.place/math-crossword/">Math Crossword</a></li>
	<li><a title="Dual N-Back - The goal of each level is to remember the state of the game exactly N timesteps ago." href="https://www.dual-n-back.io/">Dual N-Back</a></li>
</ul>
Enjoy!
