You know when you are sometimes just browsing the web, and you stumble upon a fascinating place that could be an art piece in a museum? Yes, those weird, odd, interesting websites, either because their old and charming, or because they’re trying with a different concept. Today, I am sharing a few of those places I have found over the last years.
