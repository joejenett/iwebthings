  <p><a href="http://bulltown.com/colorspeak/1/">Colorspeak</a> was created back in 1999 and is surely in need of a redesign. I'm regularly inspired by its unique content, all created by the site's visitors &ndash; a random sampling:</p>
  <div style="background:#ff0000;color:#ffffcc;padding:12px;margin:6px;">
  <p style="text-decoration:underline;">"exposure" by Rikatrix</p>
  this is the color that tells all of my secrets, exposes my insecurities, and demands my need for attention.
  </div>
  <div style="background:#000000;color:#ffffff;padding:12px;margin:6px;">
  <p style="text-decoration:underline;">"fitting in" by vanessa marie</p>
  this is the color of darkness, but when i wear it, i still feel bright and go lucky as usual. however, when i wear this color, i feel like i'm partaking along with the crowd. and that is surely not me. i'm not a crowd pleaser, i am a me pleaser. but thats ok - im still going to wear this color with pride, even if it means slightly fitting in.
  </div>
  <div style="background:#330000;color:#90ee90;padding:12px;margin:6px;">
  <p style="text-decoration:underline;">"Earth Song" by Kathleen</p>
  Feel my hand slithering through the wet earth. Cool yet warmed by the new spring. To plant a seed so it will push up to the summer sky.
