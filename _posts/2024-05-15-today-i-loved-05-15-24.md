I discovered this morning that <a title="the html review" href="https://thehtml.review/">the html review</a> redirects to Issue 03 - the interface is astounding. I check out the first link - Lizz Thabet’s <a href="https://makeyour.computer/a-home">my computer is a home that my friends can visit</a>. It’s actually an invitation to connect with her <em>computer home</em> via the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> browser.

Her home is like a big infinite desktop full of draggable folders, files, and furniture - I’m immediately enjoying this little <em>folder party</em> when I discover a text file about how I can host my own party space and then, a guide to setting up a secure spot on my own machine that can be accessed by Tor. So I’m off to find Lizz’s ‘tiny folder party generator script.’ When I do, who knows what might come out of this morning’s little excursion!

I love this stuff...
