  I've been working on a project to improve the search functionality of the <i>webthings</i> and will be releasing some new search tools sometime soon. Stay tuned for that, but in the meantime, I'd like to share some interesting <i>colorspeak</i> I discovered when searching for "story." Enjoy... </p>
  <div style="background-color:#ff00cc;color:#003300;padding:12px;margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:12px;">
  <p>
  i saw a house this colour the other day.  it was a blinding three story visual shock.

  turtlestone
  </p>
  <p>
  Where were you going?<br />
  Movement so slow it seemed like non-movement<br />
  Just a lump on the road<br />
  A slow-moving lump, legs like stumps<br />
  Eyes ancient, black, shiny as marcasites<br />
  Where were you going, moving so slow across the road?<br />
  Turtle, don't go!<br />
  We brake for wildlife here<br />
  This story won't break your heart<br />
  Tell a turtle to turn, really mean it<br />
  And he goes!<br />
  Glaring upwards, polished mud green box on legs turns<br />
  and disappears back into the dark under the trees.<br />

  Camelot
  </p>
  <p>
  It's storybook-like, but also a bit like fog. Reminds me of Camelot . . don't know why.

  Tell me a story. Make contact with me somehow, give me your words, take me with you. Show me colors, show me love, despair, kindness and pains, show me the truth or tell me lies. I need human touch.

  toy story
  </p>
  <p>
  I see the old doll's pram in the trash - remembering that she played with it incessantly, remembering the cat dressed in doll's clothes and tucked up inside without a protest. Now it's wheels are gone and it seems a sacrilege
