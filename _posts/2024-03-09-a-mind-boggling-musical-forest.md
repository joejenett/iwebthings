<p>
I’ve spent the better part of my morning exploring <a title="ambient.garden" href="https://ambient.garden/">ambient.garden</a>, a work by <a href="https://www.cusamusic.com/">music composer</a> and <a href="https://osar.fr/">programmer</a> Pierre Cusa.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
ambient.garden is an experiment that started with the question: can a composition be organized in space rather than time? Can it be experienced in space by the listener?
</p>

<p>
I come out of my little exploration having gained new insights into and heightened curiosity about the world of generative art. It leaves me rather inspired. Explore and enjoy!
