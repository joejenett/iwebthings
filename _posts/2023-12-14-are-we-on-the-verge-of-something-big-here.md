If your reading this, you already know how much I appreciate your interest. You also know I spend a fair amount of time routinely exploring the web seeking the thrill of discovering things new to me worthy of sharing. Today started with following up on a web initiative discovered just yesterday. Further exploration led me to believe we all might be on the verge of witnessing something with the potential of becoming the real beginning of the real Web 3.0. As someone I greatly admire would say, that’s not hyperbole. I’d be tickled if my hunch proves to be true.

<a href="https://pinboard.in/u:audiodude">Pinboard user audiodude</a> led me to <a title="Let's Reimagine Social | fedi.foundation" href="https://fedi.foundation/2022/09/social-networking-reimagined/">Let's Reimagine Social</a>, an article written a little over a year ago at the <a title="Social Networking Reimagined" href="https://fedi.foundation/">fedi.foundation</a> site. This initiative led me to another related initiative, the <a title="%Title%" href="https://coding.social/">Social Coding Movement</a>.

In a nutshell, what we’ve been calling <em>social media</em> has greatly distorted the true meaning of <em>social</em> and has been harmful to both the web and society. The exciting part is that the Fediverse just might be the key to building a true ‘Peopleverse.’ All of this excites  me - I simply must make time soon to explore it further ’cause it leaves me so inspired.
