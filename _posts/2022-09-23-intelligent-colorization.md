<p>I recently found and <a href="https://the.dailywebthing.com/a-vibrant-ai-colorizer-app/">shared</a> something that seemed kinda magical to me. It’s helped me directly with something I’ve been working on, so I just gotta share it with you here:</p>
<p>
<a title="Palette" href="https://palette.fm/">Palette</a> — “a vibrant AI colorizer app. Think instagram filters, but more intelligent.” 
</p>
<p>I recently added a scan of an old photo of me taken somewhere around 1970 to the image gallery at <em>bulltown.2022</em>. It was a poorly taken photo with a reddish tinge to everything but I added it anyway. It fit the spirit I’m trying to recapture with <em>bulltown</em> so I let it rip. Since then, I thought it would be nice to improve the photo but nothing materialized.</p>
<p>Before I shared <em>Palette</em> at the <em>linkport</em>, I used that old photo to play with the app and what it generated by default looked considerably better than the original - I replaced the image at bulltown. That’s the one captioned ‘default prompt’ over there on the right.</p>
<p>This morning, I decided to further explore Palette using that same old photo - only this time, I modified the prompt generated by the app in the hope that I could improve the color of the sky and it worked well except the sand on the beach lost some of it’s color. Modifying the prompt a second time fixed that too - this is one smart generator, thank you very much. The 3rd photo on the right links to the larger version, now at <em>bulltown</em>. Yep - it’s magical!</p>
<p>Update: Wrote about this <a href="https://bulltown.2022.jenett.org/journal/092422/">at bulltown</a> too.</p>
