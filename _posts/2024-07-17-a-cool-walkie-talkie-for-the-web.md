So cool! Iâ€™m excited to share this puppy.

<a title="Overtalk / A free walkie-talkie for the web." href="https://overtalk.io/">Overtalk</a>, made by a <em>web enthusiast</em> named <a title="Vasanth.V" href="https://vasanthv.github.io/">Vasanth</a>...

Music to my ears! My better half Kim and I tested it yesterday - it works great! 

I set up a channel at <a title="Overtalk / iwebthings" href="https://overtalk.io/iwebthings">Overtalk / iwebthings</a> and if it shows I'm online, feel free to give me a literal shout out.

Needless to say, this cool idea inspired me to tinker a bit with the idea of embedding the channel here at the <em>hub</em>.  

Though it worked fine in later versions of Firefox, Safari, and Vivaldi, my idea for adding the embedded channel didnâ€™t work in some other browsers, such as the older version of Waterfox I use (because it still has certain useful features that Firefox did away with). 

So. I tried a new approach - see the button at the top of the homepage. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">of the sidebar (or down there on the sidebar if youâ€™re viewing the site on your phone). </span>This new approach is experimental for now. Whether you try the embedded version or the original channel (linked below), you need to allow microphone access to use it.
