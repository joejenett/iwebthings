So cool! Iâ€™m excited to share this puppy.

<a title="Overtalk / A free walkie-talkie for the web." href="https://overtalk.io/">Overtalk</a>, made by a <em>web enthusiast</em> named <a title="Vasanth.V" href="https://vasanthv.github.io/">Vasanth</a>...

Music to my ears! My better half Kim and I tested it yesterday - it works great! 

I set up a channel at <a title="Overtalk / iwebthings" href="https://overtalk.io/iwebthings">Overtalk / iwebthings</a> and if it shows I'm online, feel free to give me a literal shout out.

Needless to say, this cool idea inspired me to tinker a bit with the idea of embedding the channel here at the <em>hub</em>.  

Though it worked fine in later versions of Firefox, Safari, and Vivaldi, the embedded channel didnâ€™t work in some other browsers, such as the older version of Waterfox I use because it still has certain useful features that Firefox did away with. So. No embedded version for now.
