	Update 07/25/24: TL:DR<br>
	After starting the walkie-talkie and joining (which includes allowing microphone access), anyone shown as ‘online’ will hear you when you speak (press and hold the ‘talk’ button). You’ll be shown as ‘online’ as long as this page remains open in your browser. 😎 <br>

So cool! I’m excited to share this puppy.

Music to my ears! My better half Kim and I tested it yesterday - it works great! 

I set up a channel at <a title="Overtalk / iwebthings" href="https://overtalk.io/iwebthings">Overtalk / iwebthings</a> and if it shows I'm online, feel free to give me a literal shout out.

Needless to say, this cool idea inspired me to tinker a bit with the idea of embedding the channel here at the <em>hub</em>.  

Though it worked fine in later versions of Firefox, Safari, and Vivaldi, my idea for adding the embedded channel didn’t work in some other browsers, such as the older version of Waterfox I use (because it still has certain useful features that Firefox did away with). 

So. I tried a new approach - see the button at the top of the homepage. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">of the sidebar (or down there on the sidebar if you’re viewing the site on your phone). </span>This new approach is experimental for now. Whether you try the embedded version or the original channel (linked below), you need to allow microphone access to use it.
