It is a way for me to express myself, to say, "Here I am. This is what I'm into. It's here if you want it, but if not that's fine, too." It's a conversation starter, not the conversation itself. It is not an end in itself, but a means to other ends. </p></blockquote></li>

Use Blogger. Hell, use Frontpage 98 if you want. Or learn some HTML And CSS and type it all up in notepad.exe. Or just HTML, don't even bother with the CSS. Just make it yours.</p></blockquote></li>
	<li style="position:relative;top:-24px;"><a title="Raw dog the open web!" href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/raw-dog-the-open-web/">Raw dog the open web!</a><blockquote><p>In our current digital landscape, where a corporate algorithm tells us what to read, watch, drink, eat, wear, smell like, and sound like, human curation of the web is an act of revolution. A simple list of hyperlinks published under a personal domain name is subversive. <strong>Curation is punk</strong>.</p></blockquote></li>
