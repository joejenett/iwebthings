The bad news is I found over 40 bad links here in the <em>hub</em> a few days ago during a long-delayed link checking session. The good news they’re all gone now. Whew!

Also completed this month, link fixing on several other <em>webthings:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>bulltown.2022</em></li>
<li><em>bulltown.neo</em></li>
<li><em>simply</em></li>
</ul>
Link checking and fixing for <em>the dailywebthing archives</em>, <em>jenett.wiki</em>, and the <em>i.webthings.directory</em> should be completed later in the month as well.

Take care y’all!

Update 08/18/25: Remaining link checking and fixing is completed.  ✔
