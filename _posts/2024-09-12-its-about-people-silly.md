I just came across a well-written perspective worth sharing this morning - an interesting reminder that the _IndieWeb_ may be what _you_ decide to make it...

You do not need Webmentions to be part of the “IndieWeb”. The only real “requirement”, if you want to think of it that way, is to just have your own site on your own domain where you put your own stuff...
