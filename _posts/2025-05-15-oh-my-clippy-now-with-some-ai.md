You might be wondering: What’s the point of all this? Why? Clippy is basically art. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think that this little app is all that magnificent or something that belongs in a museum, I mean “art” in the sense that I’ve made it like other people do watercolors or pottery - I made it because building it was fun for me...

<p style="font-size:.9rem;">Note: Perhaps a few <a href="/they-do-not-reason-the-way-humans-do/">lessons</a> would be helpful in deciding how to use the new Clippy.
