<p>Back in late 2021, <a href="https://simply.joejenett.com/heres-to-simplicity/">I wrote</a> about the need to simplify. Since then, I’ve made a number of changes ’round here and <a href="https://dwt-archives.joejenett.com/announcement/"></a> <a href="https://dwt-archives.joejenett.com/announcement/">retiring</a> <em>the dailywebthing linkport</em> and <em>daily pointers</em> represents the final phase of what I like to call the simplification project.</p>
<p>But why? I didn’t want to rename it ‘the almostdailywebthing’ and to be frank, I’m getting a little too old to keep up with the ‘daily’ part of its name. Its original mission was to be a daily-updated place for link lovers, fulfilled for over 22 years.</p>
<p>Being a link lover myself, I don’t plan on going anywhere. If you’re disappointed <em>the dailywebthing</em> is no more, I hope you’ll let me try to make it up to you on a regular, though not daily basis. For now, here’s a few recent finds:</p>
