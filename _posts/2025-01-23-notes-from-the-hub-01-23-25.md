Over the last few weeks, Iâ€™ve been working hard to optimize the <em>webthings</em> for mobile. Whatâ€™s different this time is Iâ€™ve been testing my sites at 8 different screen sizes using the <a title="Responsively App - A web developer's browser" href="https://responsively.app/"><em>Responsively</em> browser</a> - what an amazing tool!

The project started when I came to the realization that testing only on my own mobile devices had been insufficient. Testing my recent improvements to the button walls and <a href="https://bulltown.joejenett.com/images/">images</a> at <em>bulltown</em> at the wider number of screen sizes opened my eyes. After fixing bulltown I decided to move on to the other <em>webthings</em>.

Many other devices fall into the screen sizes used, and Iâ€™m pleased to say the mobile experience for each of the following <em>webthings</em> is now greatly improved:
<ul style="font-size:.95em;">
<li><a href="https://iwebthings.joejenett.com/">i.webthings hub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://directory.joejenett.com/">i.webthings directory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bulltown.joejenett.com/">bulltown2022</a></li>

</ul>
ðŸ˜Ž Yay!
