I think I&#8217;m getting closer to what I envisioned for the _i.webthings hub_. A recent change made to resolve the problem of sending unintentional ‘webmention spam’ seems to have also improved the integration of this site with my others.

Posts that are syndicated here from my various other sites now use permalinks to the original posts on those sites. The change solved the problem of sending multiple webmentions to linked sites. As it turns out, it also makes the hub more of a direct springboard to my other websites. Each site includes a prominent link back to the hub, which seems like a fairly usable setup for those who like to explore the web. I guess we&#8217;ll see if that&#8217;s the case. Enjoy!
