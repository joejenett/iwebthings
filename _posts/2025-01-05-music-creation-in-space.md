Last night, I revisited an old fave, a little musical toy called <a title="PLINK! - by Dinahmoe" href="https://dinahmoelabs.com/plink/"><small>PLINK</small>! </a> by Dinahmoe Labs. After a bit of fun <em>jamming with strangers</em>, I decided to check out Dinahmoe Labs’ homepage and found yet another cool musical toy:

<a title="by Dinahmoe Labs - Transforming silence into unappreciated effort." href="https://dinahmoelabs.com/tonecraft"><small>TONECRAFT</small></a>
<blockquote>
<p>
addictive, meditative, music creation in space
</p>
</blockquote>
Note: I also discovered that the above work best in Safari and Chrome. 

Firefox: not so much.

If you dig in a little, you’ll find other musical toys and while I don’t typically link to commercial portfolios, I’ll just say the information link will get you there - but be warned, you may be astounded...
