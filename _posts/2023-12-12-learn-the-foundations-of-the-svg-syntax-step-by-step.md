The brief time I spent reading just a few of the tutorials, I found answers to a number of questions I've always had about <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> coding. In my opinion, a well-written primer that should be useful to anyone who wants to learn the basics or fill in some gaps in their existing knowledge of the syntax. Bravo! ðŸ˜Ž
