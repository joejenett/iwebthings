<blockquote><p><a href="https://infinipedia.ai/">Infinipedia</a> is an experiment with an infinite, self-writing, self-improving language-model generated wiki. You can rabbit-hole any concept, following links that are generated if they do not exist. Articles are periodically optimized using human and AI feedback, and a clustered visualization with text embeddings is provided to allow you to see related pages. </p></blockquote>

Naturally, to begin my scientific exploration into this newfound puppy, I started with <a title="Searched at Infinipedia" href="https://infinipedia.ai/wiki/Iwebthings.joejenett.com">Iwebthings.joejenett.com</a> (which led to <a title="Created at Infinipedia" href="https://infinipedia.ai/wiki/Joe_Jenett">Joe Jenett</a>).
