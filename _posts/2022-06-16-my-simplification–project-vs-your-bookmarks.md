<h2>the project</h2>
<p>Last November on the <em>simply.</em> blog, I <a href="https://simply.jenett.org/heres-to-simplicity/" title="here’s to simplicity❗️">mentioned</a> completing the first phase of a simplification project started earlier that year.</p>
<blockquote><p>Too many domains, too many Wordpress installations, and too many things to keep updated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though the <em>simply.</em> blog was a simple name/subdomain change, some other sites were moved to new URLs - they became subdomains of jenett.org (intended to be more permanent locations). Several inactive sites were converted from Wordpress to static archives while this site and the <em>simply.</em> blog were migrated from Wordpress to Jekyll and remain active, powered by <em>GitHub Pages</em>.</p>
<h2>your bookmarks</h2>
<p>First off, if you have bookmarks (or links) to any of my sites - thank you - you’re the reason I do this web thing and I’m tickled. Thanks for visiting again!</p>
<p>For the majority of my sites, redirects to the new URLs continue to be in place where applicable. However, there’s three archived sites with redirects soon to become inactive due to my intentionally letting their original domain names expire (as part of the simplification project). If you have any of the following bookmarked (or linked), I’d appreciate your updating your bookmark(s) soon if needed - 😎  - ’cause I sure hope you stop by again in the future:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://joesblues.jenett.org/">joe’s blues</a><br />Current URL is https://joesblues.jenett.org/.<br />The redirect will become inactive as of 6/17/22.</li>
<li style="margin-top:6px;"><a href="https://linkscatter.jenett.org/">linkscatter</a><br />Current URL is https://linkscatter.jenett.org/.<br />The redirect will become inactive as of 6/22/22.</li>
<li style="margin-top:6px;"><a href="https://deskphotos.jenett.org/">deskphotos</a><br />Current URL is https://deskphotos.jenett.org/.<br />The redirect will become inactive as of 8/7/22.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>That’s it for now - take care!</p>
