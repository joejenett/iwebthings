I&#8217;d like to share a visual representation of the content found at the [dailywebthing linkport](http://dailywebthing.com/), based on the number of posts in each category.

The content of the dailywebthing consists primarily of links and the &#8216;word cloud&#8217; above tells you a bit about me â€“ at least, I think it does.
