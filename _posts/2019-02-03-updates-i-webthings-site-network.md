<small>Update 02/07/19: Revisions below reflect changes made due to recently received feedback.</small>

I&#8217;ve pretty much finished the first stage of upgrading the five sites which I consider part of the _i.webthings family_. These are the most active and regularly updated sites among [those](https://jenett.org/webthings/) I&#8217;ve built.

The project involved migrating the sites from an outdated &#8216;legacy&#8217; version of moveabletype to WordPress, which allowed for easier addition of indieweb functionality and a different design approach, which I rather enjoy.

## sites in the family
(updated 03/01/22)

  * [i.webthings](https://iwebthings.jenett.org/) [<img style="max-width: 13px; margin-left: 5px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rss.png" alt="Subscribe" />](https://iwebthings.jenett.org/feed.atom)[<img style="max-width: 16px; margin-left: 5px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/twitter.png" alt="Follow i.webthings on Twitter" />](https://www.twitter.com/iwebthings)
  * [the dailywebthing linkport](https://the.dailywebthing.com/) [<img style="max-width: 13px; margin-left: 5px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rss.png" alt="Subscribe" />](https://the.dailywebthing.com/feed)[<img style="max-width: 16px; margin-left: 5px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/twitter.png" alt="Follow the dailywebthing via i.webthings on Twitter" />](https://www.twitter.com/iwebthings)
  * [dwt daily pointers](https://pointers.dailywebthing.com/) [<img style="max-width: 13px; margin-left: 5px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rss.png" alt="Subscribe" />](https://pointers.dailywebthing.com/feed)[<img style="max-width: 16px; margin-left: 5px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/twitter.png" alt="Follow dwt pointers via i.webthings on Twitter" />](https://www.twitter.com/iwebthings)
  * [simply.](https://simply.jenett.org/) [<img style="max-width: 13px; margin-left: 5px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rss.png" alt="Subscribe" />](https://simply.jenett.org/feed.atom)[<img style="max-width: 16px; margin-left: 5px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/twitter.png" alt="Follow joejenett on Twitter" />](https://www.twitter.com/joejenett)

As noted above, the first three sites in the list are associated with [@iwebthings](https://www.twitter.com/iwebthings) while the last two are associated with [@joejenett](https://www.twitter.com/joejenett). <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If I&#8217;ve done things right, all posts from these five sites will cross-post automatically to their respective twitter accounts, and should receive webmentions from the twitter platform as well starting tomorrow.</span>&#8211;> Occasionally, posts from these sites may be cross-posted to twitter.

Though I said I&#8217;ve completed this stage, I have to admit I&#8217;ll still be watching and fixing things that may go awry. For now, let&#8217;s see how it goes. I hope you enjoy <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">these new ways of</span> following and interacting with the _i.webthings family_. The future is certainly now.
