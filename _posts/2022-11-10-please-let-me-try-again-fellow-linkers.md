<p>Last month when I wrote about <em>we.Link</em>, my tongue-in-cheek approach though fun for me failed miserably in telling you anything about the project. So please allow me another shot.</p> 
<p>You may have noticed a new version of the <em>we.Link</em> widget is back on the sidebar. It now uses lightweight javascript, based on <a href="https://garlic.garden/onionring/">onionring.js</a> - thanks <a href="https://allium.house/">joey + mord</a>!</p>
<h2>here’s the deal</h2>
<p>Right now, I’m testing <em>we.Link</em> using only some of my own sites, 4 including this site (the ‘hub’). It would be boring to leave it at that. My little <em>linkring</em> widget over there already provides the same functionality with it’s ‘random’ link. At the moment, the only difference between the two widgets, besides navigation choices, is that <em>we.Link</em> is limited to directory-like sites. And that’s the point.</p>
<p>Clicking on ‘we.Link’ sends you to a random member site (other than the one you’re on). It’s a compact, minimal, and easy-to-add widget.</p>
<p>If you have a directory, blogroll or some other <em>linking</em> site, I might want to invite you to join my little network. I know of several readers with sites I’d love to include. If you have a directory-like site and you’re willing to add a few lines of code to your site, please <a href="https://jenett.org/contact/">let me know</a>. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
