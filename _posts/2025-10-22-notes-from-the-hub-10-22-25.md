Due to ongoing issues with the software I’ve been using to upload batches of new bookmarks to Pinboard, I’ve recently made a change (for the better) in my workflow.

Instead of updating Pinboard periodically with batches of new bookmarks created and collected in my browser, I’m now creating each Pinboard bookmark at the same time I bookmark the site in my browser, while curating sites to share.  <small>(<a href="https://pinboard.in/howto/">howto</a>)</small>

It’s more efficient and saves a lot of time - how refreshing!

If yer interested, my 10 most recent Pinboard bookmarks are over there on the sidebar (experimental). 

Enjoy!
