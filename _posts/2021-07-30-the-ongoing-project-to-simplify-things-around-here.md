Back in April, I did away with the _simply. micro._ blog by integrating its content into the _simply. personal_ blog as a category. Original permalinks work and I can still add new micro content. It made sense to me. I also archived two other blogs I had decided to stop updating. In the process of making these changes, I was able to remove three WordPress installations and databases. Less bloat. Less waste of server resources and power. Less demand for my attention. Yay!<!-- excerpt-end -->

Also recently, I decided to discontinue syndicating content from my various _webthings_ here. Maintaining links is a time-consuming part of _the dailywebthing_ and _daily pointers_ and having those same links duplicated here just doubles the time it takes for fixing/removing bad links. To be honest, I need that time to keep up with _curating_!

Besides, the number of posts accumulating on this blog over time was getting out of hand. Again, less bloat. Unfortunately, this change resulted in no longer providing a combined feed for all the _webthings_. Nice guy! I offer my readers a unique convenience and then take it away. For that, I am sorry.

Iâ€™m just getting started. The simplification project still has a long way to go. Watch this space for details as things further develop.

Cheers.
