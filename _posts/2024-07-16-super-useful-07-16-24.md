My recent rebuilding of <a href="https://bulltown.joejenett.com/071424/"><em>bulltown</em></a> required a fair amount of  troubleshooting
related to webmentions. 

After spending hours researching, changing, and testing over and over again, I discovered a tool made by <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron Parecki</a> - you know, the guy behind <a title="Webmention.io" href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> and <a title="Telegraph" href="https://telegraph.p3k.io/">Telegraph</a> - a key player in the <a title="IndieWeb" href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> community. 

The tool saved me hours and gave me a fresh start on optimizing webmentions on <em>bulltown</em> s well as two other <em>webthings</em>. If you code your own website and use webmentions, you might find it useful too:
