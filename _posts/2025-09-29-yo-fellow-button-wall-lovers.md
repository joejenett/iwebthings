Anyone who knows me knows I’m kind of a button wall nut. There’s almost 1,200 buttons on the <a href="https://bulltown.joejenett.com/links/"><em>bulltown</em> links page</a> and I’ve gotta admit I’m a bit obsessed with finding new ones almost daily. Love ’em!

So when I bumped into this recently I was excited:

I gave it a go this morning and it works like a charm - though you do miss the visual goodness of each link compared to browsing the wall. Nevertheless, a nifty discovery tool. Explore and enjoy!
