2025! For each of us, may it be the best year ever!

I’m learning that some web projects can only be completed in stages. Reaching perfection isn’t possible - there’s always a next stage. 

The first stage of my accessibility improvement project was recently completed for seven <em>webthings</em>:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://iwebthings.joejenett.com/">i.webthings hub</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://joejenett.com/">a.k.a. joe jenett</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://directory.joejenett.com/">i.webthings directory</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://dwt-archives.joejenett.com/">the dailywebthing archives</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://simply.joejenett.com/">simply.</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bulltown.joejenett.com/">bulltown.2022</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://bulltown.neocities.org/">bulltown.neo</a>
</li>
</ul>
In addition, <em>the dailywebthings archives</em> site is virtually free of bad links at the moment. The next link check in 3-4 weeks, as usual, should uncover 15-30 more poopoos (which occurred between now and then)...

Cheers!
