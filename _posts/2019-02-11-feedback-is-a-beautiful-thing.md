Learned a bit about ActivityPub and Bridgy Fed from Chris Aldrich&#8217;s [response](https://boffosocko.com/2019/02/09/mastodon-spam-wordpress-and-the-indieweb/ "Chris Aldrich") to Kicks&#8217; [link with comments](https://www.kickscondor.com/joe's-syndicated-links-considered-'spam'-by-some-mastodon-instance/) to my last post. After having completed some testing over the last few days, I&#8217;m pleased to say it looks like I would be able to give visitors of _the dailywebthing linkport_ and _dwt daily pointers_ an easy way to follow those sites from Mastodon, etc. if I ultimately decide to add it as a permanent feature.

The key is being able to make my sites “act as stand-alone members of the Fediverse” instead of having to use a public Mastodon instance for posting (or cross-posting). My linkblogs use a different theme than my personal blogs and required using Bridgy Fed (the personal blogs work using ActivityPub only).

I do tend to agree with Kicks&#8217; comments as to how some public instances may have &#8220;a somewhat narrow view of what’s ‘relevant.’ In my case, that seemed to be a factor.

Thanks Kicks for your comments and Chris for your helpful response.
