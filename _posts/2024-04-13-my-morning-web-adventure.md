I’m a sucker for online generators. Early this morning, I decided to explore one I recently bumped into:

<a title="Forskningsrådet - Generator" href="https://dubins-generator.surge.sh/">Forskningsrådet - Generator</a><br>[<a href="https://pinboard.in/u:ericellis">ericellis</a>]

There’s no help or other site information, so I just started playing around with its controls to create graphics - had a lot of fun tinkering with shapes and color on a gridded background. Bingo! Gotta share it.

As usual, I wanted to know more about this newly-found toy and checked the source for a description but found none.

I was hoping the site’s title might shed some light. Forskningsrådet is the Norwegian name for <a title="The Research Council of Norway" href="https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/">The Research Council of Norway</a>. 

That didn't satisfy my curiousity so I decided to see what I could find out about “dubins,” which appears in the site’s url. I learned about <a title="Dubins path - Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubins_path">Dubins path</a>, having to do with mathematicians’ quest to find the shortest optimal path for wheeled robots to keep moving forward. Whoa!

I also found a few other related sites in the process:

<a title="Lester Dubins - Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Dubins">Lester Dubins (1920-2010)</a><br><a title="Shortest Path for the Dubins Car - Wolfram Demonstrations Project" href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ShortestPathForTheDubinsCar/">Shortest Path for the Dubins Car</a><br><a title="GitHub - gieseanw/Dubins" href="https://github.com/gieseanw/Dubins">Dubins: Generate paths for a Dubins car of arbitrary turning radius</a>

Color me distracted and curious (the way I like it). Enjoy!
