<p>So. You've got a directory (wink wink) or a blogroll (nudge nudge)! What do we have in common?</p>
<p style="font-size:1.45em;font-weight:700;">we.Link.</p>
<p style="text-decoration:line-through;">Being curious as you are, go play with the button over there on the sidebar. Are you thinking what Iâ€™m thinking? If you decide youâ€™d like to be part of this experiment, do let me know. A network is in order.  You know who you are - letâ€™s make some noise! (And please tell your friends.) ðŸ˜Ž</p>
<p style="font-weight:500;font-size:.9em;">Update 10/09/22: The <em>we.Link</em> project has been discontinued for now.</p>
<p style="font-weight:500;font-size:.9em;">Update 11/05/22: The <em>i.w linkring</em> project has been reimplemented.</p>
