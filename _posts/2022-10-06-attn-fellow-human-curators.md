<p>So. You've got a directory (wink wink) or a blogroll (nudge nudge)! What do we have in common?</p>
<p style="font-size:1.45em;font-weight:700;">we.Link.</p>
<p style="text-decoration:line-through;">Being curious as you are, go play with the button over there on the sidebar. Are you thinking what Iâ€™m thinking? If you decide youâ€™d like to be part of this experiment, do let me know. A network is in order.  You know who you are - letâ€™s make some noise! (And please tell your friends.) ðŸ˜Ž</p>
<p style="font-weight:500;font-size:.9em;">Update 10/09/22: The <em>we.Link</em> project has been discontinued for now.</p>
<p style="font-weight:500;font-size:.9em;">Update 11/05/22: The <em>i.w linkring</em> project has been reimplemented.</p>

Hey there Poorchop - sorry I missed your question - didn't have my notifications set correctly. Actually, nothing happened. I was hoping this kinda cryptic, tongue-in-cheek post about we.Link would be understood. Maybe it would be better if I just came out and explained what I had in mind, which is something I might do in a new post soon.

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:16px;">As far as the little webring goes, I thought I was the only one getting anything out of it. If you liked it or found it useful, just say the word and I'll gladly restore it - no biggie.</p>

I gotta admit I missed my little webring so itâ€™s back. Enjoy if you will... ðŸ˜Ž
