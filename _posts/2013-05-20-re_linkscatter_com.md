  <p>In light of current events, I've severed all ties with Tumblr. As a result, linkscatter.com is temporarily offline. I'll be busy migrating its content to my own servers and hope to have it up and running again very soon. Sorry for the inconvenience.

  Update, 11:58pm: The lights are back on and a few entries have been re-posted to the <a href="http://linkscatter.com/">new <i>linkscatter</i></a>. Slowly but surely, I'll be restoring a good amount of its content and original permalinks. Yay!
