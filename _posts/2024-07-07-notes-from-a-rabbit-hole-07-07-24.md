Sorry to report that the cli software I linked to originally in this post appears to be broken. For me, anyway.

One thing I’ve learned is when one jumps into a rabbit hole, they need to know when to jump back out. After spending several hours trying to get the software to work, I decided to do just that.

In case I’m right about there being something wrong with the software, I’ve decided to remove the link. So it goes. Oh well.

For now, I’ll just say I’ve using <a title="DB Browser for SQLite" href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">DB Browser for SQLite</a> for years and like it. It’s an installed app with a graphical user interface and it works great. So much for having something similar to use in the terminal. One less rabbit hole to deal with, thank you very much.
