This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of the Sites. Some policies only apply to sites with certain features.

## What personal data we may collect and why we collect it

### Comments

If applicable, when visitors leave comments on the sites, we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help in spam detection and management.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: <a href='https://automattic.com/privacy/' target='_blank' class='url' rel="noopener noreferrer">https://automattic.com/privacy/</a>. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Contact forms

If you use our Contact forms, your name and email address is collected along with your message(s). We consider your message(s) and other information provided to be private and confidential and treat them as such (unless you specify otherwise). 

## How your personal data is used

Any personal information you provide will only be used for us to communicate with you regarding the sites or as otherwise described in this document. Your personal data will never be shared with third parties except as described nor will it ever be used for promotional or marketing purposes.

## Other information

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our sites, you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

If applicable, when you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select "Remember Me", your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on these sites may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, widgets, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other websites.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to those websites.

### Log Data

Like many sites operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our sites ("Log Data"). 

This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our sites that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics. This data may be used at our discretion to block users we feel are abusing comment or contact forms, or other interactive features on our site(s). 

We do not utilize any analytic or tracking services, nor do we use tracking cookies, though embedded content (such as a twitter widget) may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, as explained above.

We do not share your data.

## How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our websites (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

## What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on these sites, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

## Where we send your data

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

## Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of ​February, 2020​ and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page. 

If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by placing prominent notices on our websites.
